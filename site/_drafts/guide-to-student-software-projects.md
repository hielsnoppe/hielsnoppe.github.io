# Project management

# Source code management

1. Learn Git.
1. Share your code early. `git push` or it didn't happen. Also "works on my machine" means, it doesn't work.

# Coding

1. Do pair-programming. The less experience you have, the more experience your partner should have. If you are the expert in your team, remember: Refusing to teach the inexperienced doesn't make you smart-ass, but ass-hole.
