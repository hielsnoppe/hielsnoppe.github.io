I started dancing at [Tanzschule Dieter Keller][tskeller] in 20XX at the age of XX.
XX years later I joined [Blau-Silber Berlin][blausilber] and first participated in a competition with my former partner Lili in 20XX.
In 2010 I joined [Rot-Gold Berlin][rotgold] and since then I am dancing with Annalena,
who had also collected several years of experience with her previous partner Katja.

In the following three years we advanced from Adult C to Adult S Standard and had our share of good placings.
Highlights of our career include winning the Berlin regional championships in Adult A Standard in 2013 and the reception to [Team Berlin][kader].
Currently we are working hard to improve our dancing, to strengthen our position in regional and to reach out for the next round in national and international competitions.
Besides we enjoy doing [show performances](#shows) from time to time.
