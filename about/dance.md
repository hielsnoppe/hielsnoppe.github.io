# Ballroom dancing

I started dancing at [Tanzschule Dieter Keller][tskeller] in 2005 at the age of 14.
Less than two years later I joined [Blau-Silber Berlin][blausilber] and first participated in a competition with my former partner Lili in 2008.
In 2010 I joined [Rot-Gold Berlin][rotgold] and since then I am dancing with [Annalena][facebook],
who had also collected several years of experience with her previous partner Katja.

In the following three years we advanced from Adult C to Adult S Standard and had our share of good placings.
Highlights of our career include winning the Berlin regional championships in Adult A Standard in 2013, the reception to [Team Berlin][kader] and ranking 3rd in the Berlin regional championships in Adult S Standard as well as ranking 21st in the German national championships in 2017.
Currently we are working hard to improve our dancing, to strengthen our position in regional and to reach out for the next round in national and international competitions.
